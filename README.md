# ThePlugDiary
ThePlugDiary is my first application and I will continue improving it in future updates as I learn and develop my skills.

What is ThePlugDiary?
It is a place where you can store all your ideas and personal notes securely. All data is saved locally in C:\ThePlugDiary along with your settings.

Features:
- Black, White, Sea, RGB & Custom background colors
- English / Greek language support
- Local data storage for privacy
- Simple and clean interface

Since this is my first project, the application may contain bugs or small issues as I continue improving my coding skills.

The project is built using Python.

I welcome feedback and bug reports through my Discord server.
